					<h2>Some points up front</h2>
					<ul>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">This talk will stay away from the sales pitch stuff</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Not that much practical advice</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's really just about understanding what WASM is at a fundamental
							level</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Will be fairly techical</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Will not talk about performance</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">I'm by no means an expert!!</li>

					<h3>What is Wasm?</h3>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">The typical definition you'll find is the following: "WebAssembly,
						shortened to Wasm,
						is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine"</p>
				</section>

					<h2>DEMO TIME</h2>

			<section>
				<p>So, just like in our demo, WASM is the equivalent to our binary ".avr" file. (That's the first reason
					why webASSEMBLY isn't a great name - it isn't assembly ðŸ™ƒ)</p>
				<p class="fragment fade-in">A key point to remember is that just like in our demo there were no
					instructions that were
					able to access anything on the system, all it was able to do was manipulate the stack and some
					memory,
					this is also the case for WASM. It's entirely sandbox and can't access anything outside of its
					own environment.

					<h3>WAT</h3>
					<p>WAT (yes, that's what it's called) is short for WebAssembly Text Format. While WASM is in fact
						a binary format, there is a text format for WASM.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>WABT</h3>
					<p>(Aren't these names awesome?) WABT stands for WebAssembly Binary Toolkit. It's a suite of
						tools used for working with WASM.
