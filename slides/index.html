						<li class="fragment fade-in">This talk will stay away from the sales pitch stuff</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Not that much practical advice</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">It's really just about understanding what WASM is at a fundamental
							level</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Will be fairly techical</li>
						<li class="fragment fade-in">Will not talk about performance</li>

					<h3>What is Wasm?</h3>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">The typical definition you'll find is the following: "WebAssembly,
						shortened to Wasm,
						is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine"</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>DEMO TIME</h2>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>So, just like in our demo, WASM is the equivalent to our binary ".avr" file. (That's the first reason
					why webASSEMBLY isn't a great name - it isn't assembly ðŸ™ƒ)</p>
				<p class="fragment fade-in">A key point to remember is that just like in our demo there were no
					instructions that were
					able to access anything on the system, all it was able to do was manipulate the stack and some
					memory.
					This is also the case for WASM - it's entirely sandboxex and cannot access anything outside of its
					own environment.
				</p>

					<h3>WAT</h3>
					<p>WAT (yes, that's what it's called) is short for WebAssembly Text Format. While WASM is in fact
						a binary format, there is a text format for WASM.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>WABT</h3>
					<p>(Aren't these names awesome?) WABT stands for WebAssembly Binary Toolkit. It's a suite of
						tools used for working with WASM.

				<h3>Exports and Imports</h3>
				<p class="fragment fade-in"><strong>Exports:</strong>
					A WASM module can export functions that the WASM host can then call. In our example, we saw how 
					from within our JavaScript we were able to get access to the exported add function and
					then call it from JS.
				</p>
				<p class="fragment fade-in"><strong>Imports:</strong>
					This is the opposite. Imports are functions that can be defined by the host, and then imported into
					WASM module. Said differently, this is a way for WASM to call back into JavaScript.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<p>For the upcoming demos, we'll be using C, however we'll be using a very raw approach. 
					I'd like to stress that this is not how WASM applications
					are typically built. There's a toolchain known as Emscripten that provides a lot more 
					functionality, but in the interest of understanding the underlying machinery, we'll be
					doing it as raw as possible.
